# SORT (Simple Online Realtime Tracking)

This implementation is improved over the original SORT Repo, https://github.com/abewley/sort

### Introduction
SORT is a barebones implementation of a visual multiple object tracking framework based on rudimentary data association and state estimation techniques. It is designed for online tracking applications where only past and current frames are available and the method produces object identities on the fly. While this minimalistic tracker doesn't handle occlusion or re-entering objects its purpose is to serve as a baseline and testbed for the development of future trackers.
